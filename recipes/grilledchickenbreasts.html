    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The best grilled chicken breasts you'll ever make begin with a basic marinade and end with the best technique for perfect cooking, complete with beautifully-executed grill marks.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Olive oil: Our perfect marinade starts with olive oil, which is essential for locking in moisture. </li>
        <li>Dijon: Dijon mustard adds complex, sharp, pleasantly tangy flavor.</li>
        <li>Honey: Honey lends subtle sweetness. </li>
        <li>Soy sauce: Soy sauce adds umami-rich saltiness. </li>
        <li>Lemon juice: Lemon juice brightens things up a bit. </li>
        <li>Garlic: Of course, fresh garlic is necessary for the most flavorful marinade.</li>
        <li>Ground spices: Onion powder and ground ginger take the flavor up a notch. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Trim the chicken and pound to an even thickness.</li>
        <li>Make the marinade, then marinate the chicken at least four hours or up to overnight.</li>
        <li>Grill the chicken. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Note: You'll know the chicken is perfectly cooked when it releases easily and has dark brown grill marks. This should take about 3 minutes per side, but we canâ€™t underestimate the importance of a meat thermometer. Inserted into the thickest part of the breast, the thermometer should read at least 165 degrees F. </p>
